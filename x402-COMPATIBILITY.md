## Spec Error Codes

All `invalidReason` / `errorReason` values follow the x402 v2 spec naming convention:

| Error Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `unsupported_scheme` | Scheme is not `"exact"` |
| `invalid_network` | CAIP-2 network not supported |
| `invalid_payload` | Missing or malformed payload/authorization |
| `invalid_exact_evm_payload_signature` | ERC-2612 / Ed25519 signature verification failed |
| `invalid_exact_evm_payload_authorization_valid_before` | Permit expired (`now > validBefore`) |
| `invalid_exact_evm_payload_authorization_valid_after` | Permit not yet valid (`now < validAfter`) |
| `invalid_exact_evm_payload_authorization_value_mismatch` | Amount less than required |
| `invalid_exact_evm_payload_recipient_mismatch` | Spender or recipient doesn't match |
| `insufficient_funds` | On-chain token balance too low |

---

## v1 Backward Compatibility

The facilitator accepts both v1 (flat) and v2 (envelope) payloads:

- **Detection:** v1 payloads lack the `accepted` envelope (`!payload.accepted`)
- **Normalization:** v1 fields are wrapped into v2 format internally (`maxAmountRequired` → `amount`)
- **Response:** Same response shape for both versions
- **/supported:** Advertises both `x402Version: 1` and `x402Version: 2` kinds per network

---

## Security Validation

187 unit tests cover:

- **Amount manipulation:** zero, negative, uint256 max, non-numeric values
- **Address injection:** zero address, malformed, wrong length, case sensitivity
- **Deadline attacks:** far-future, validAfter in future, deadline=0, boundary conditions
- **Spender mismatch:** wrong facilitator address, case-insensitive comparison
- **Cross-network attacks:** EVM payload with Solana network, Solana payload with EVM network
- **Type confusion:** null, array, string, undefined, boolean payloads
- **Nonce replay protection:** server-side dedup rejects double-settle before on-chain submission
- **Signature edge cases:** empty, non-hex, oversized, undefined signatures
- **Oversized payloads:** >1MB payload handling
- **Rate limiting:** per-IP throttling on payment endpoints
- **Input size limiting:** 100kb body limit with 413 response

## Our Extensions (Not in x402 Spec)

These are additive/non-breaking fields we include beyond the spec:

| Extension | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `remainingSeconds` | `/verify` | Seconds until permit expires — helps resource servers decide settle timing |
| `expiredAt` | `/settle` | Unix timestamp when permit expired (on rejection) |
| `suggestRetry` | `/settle` | Hints that client should re-sign with fresh permit |
| Pre-settle deadline check | `/settle` | Rejects permits expired or within 30s of expiry before submitting on-chain |
| Gas estimation dry-run | `/settle` | Calls `estimateContractGas` before submitting permit tx to catch reverts |
| Nonce replay protection | `/settle` | Server-side dedup prevents double-settle (saves gas) |
| Rate limiting | `/verify`, `/settle` | 60 req/min per IP with `429` + `Retry-After` header |
| Input size limit | All POST | 100kb body limit with `413 payload_too_large` response |
| HTML content negotiation | `/supported` | Returns HTML view when `Accept: text/html` header present |
| v1 backward compatibility | `/verify`, `/settle` | Accepts flat v1 payloads alongside v2 envelope format |

---

## Notes

- **Scheme:** Only `"exact"` scheme is currently defined in x402 v2. Deferred/subscribe schemes are not part of the spec yet.
- **EVM mechanism:** SBC token uses ERC-2612 Permit (not EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization`). The x402 v2 spec accommodates both via `extra.assetTransferMethod`.
- **Settlement status codes:** Per spec, `/settle` always returns HTTP 200; success/failure is communicated via `success` boolean in the body.
- **validAfter check:** Added 2026-03-09. Spec step 4 requires checking both `validAfter` and `validBefore` time bounds.
- **Spender validation:** Added 2026-03-09. Spec step 5 requires `authorization.to` matches facilitator's own address.
