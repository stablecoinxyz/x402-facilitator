# x402-facilitator

SBC x402 Facilitator - Verify and Settle Payments.

This implementation supports **v1** of the x402 protocol.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file based on your configuration requirements (check source code for needed variables).

## Usage

### Quick Demo (Devnet)

We have provided a complete demo environment that runs on Solana Devnet.

1.  **Setup the environment:**
    This script will generate wallets, airdrop Devnet SOL, create a test token, fund the client wallet, and generate the `.env` file.
    ```bash
    npm run setup
    ```

2.  **Start the server** in one terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Run the demo client** in another terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run demo
    ```

    The demo client sends a payment request to the facilitator. The facilitator then:
    1.  Verifies the signature and balance.
    2.  Executes the settlement (transfers tokens from Client to Merchant).
    3.  Returns the transaction hash (viewable on Solana Explorer).

### Configuration

Configuration is handled via `.env`. A default `.env` is generated by `npm run setup`.
