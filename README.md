SBC x402 Facilitator - Verify and Settle Payments.

This implementation supports **v1** of the x402 protocol.

## Installation

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file based on your configuration requirements (check source code for needed variables).

## Usage

### Quick Demo (Base Sepolia)

We have provided a complete demo environment that runs on Base Sepolia.

1.  **Setup the environment:**
    This script will generate EVM wallets for Client, Merchant, and Facilitator.
    It will check for ETH balance. **If you have no funds, it will pause and provide faucet links.**
    Once funded, it will wrap ETH to WETH (to simulate an ERC20 token) and approve the Facilitator to spend it.
    ```bash
    npm run setup
    ```

2.  **Start the server** in one terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Run the demo client** in another terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run demo
    ```

    The demo client sends a payment request to the facilitator. The facilitator then:
    1.  Verifies the EIP-712 signature and WETH balance.
    2.  Executes the settlement (transfers WETH from Client to Merchant using `transferFrom`).
    3.  Returns the transaction hash (viewable on BaseScan).
